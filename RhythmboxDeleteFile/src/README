Intent:
Useful for deleting unwanted music from the library and harddisk. 
No need to go through new music and filter the things you like.
Just delete the ugly stuff when you encounter it the first time. :)

Install:
1. Install the following packages (names taken from Ubuntu):
     - python-xlib (python module)
     - trash-cli (trash command)
     - libnotify-bin (notify-send command)
2. Copy this directory into ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins

Structure should then look like this:

~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/
    deletefile/
        deletefile.rb-plugin
        __init__.py
        
3. Restart Rhythmbox
4. Go to Edit -> Plugins -> enable "Delete current song from harddisk"

Usage:
If you ever find song disgusting, hit Mod4+Up (Mod4 == WindowsKey) and it will get deleted (moved to trash bin).
    
Configuring:
To change the hotkey, run xbindkeys -k (install xbindkeys first) and set the relevant keysyms in __init__.py.

    Sample:
    1. Open terminal
    1. Execute xbindkeys -k
    2. Press Mod4+Up
    3. xbindkeys prints:
        "NoCommand"
            m:0x40 + c:111
            Mod4 + Up
    4. open ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/plugins/deletefile/__init__.py
    5. change relevant fields to:
        # Mod4+Up
        delete_key = 111
        delete_mask = 0x40
    6. Save, restart rhythmbox
    Note: You could also edit deletefile.rb-plugin to print the new hotkey in the description. :)
    NoteToo: Mod4 + Up doesn't always work with xbindkeys. If so, first get the keysym for the key (Up), 
                and then get the keysym for the modifier (Mod4) in two steps
